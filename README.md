# About

This project is Skeleton for writing Node code in TypeScript.. 


# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/suyyala/node-typescript-skeleton.git <project_name>
```
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```

```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!
